## v2.1.0 – Emotion-Aware Dream Replay

### Added
- Dream priority calculation for memory replay
- Emotion-aware memory replay during dream cycles
- Integration of `EmotionStore` with the Dream Engine
- Emotion-aware replay support in the Replay Engine
- Emotion-aware dream processing in `MemoryManager`
- Dream priority tests
- Emotion-aware replay tests

### Improved
- Dream replay now prioritizes memories using:
  - Memory strength
  - Memory importance
  - Emotional significance
  - Emotional intensity
- High-intensity emotional memories can receive higher replay priority
- Dream cycles now use emotional context when selecting memories for replay

---

## v2.0.0 – Emotion-Aware Memory Processing

### Added
- Emotion model
- Rule-based emotion detector
- Emotion store
- Emotion engine
- Emotion-aware retrieval
- Emotion integration into `MemoryManager`
- Emotion detector tests
- Emotion engine tests
- Emotion store tests
- Emotion model tests

### Improved
- Retrieval now considers emotional intensity, valence, and arousal
- Memory importance is dynamically adjusted based on detected emotions
- High-arousal memories decay more slowly
- Memory pipeline now performs emotion detection before retrieval
